Step 1: Initialize an array a[] with values

Step 2: Assign two empty arrays oddArray[] and evenArray[] to store the odd and even numbers separately

Step 3: Assing the size of the array into the variable size using the built-in function count()

Step 4: Print the elements of the array arr[] using for loop

Step 5: Assign the value 0 into the variables j and k

Step 6: Assign the value 0 into the variable i and perform the sub-step until the condition 'i < size' becomes false and increment the value of variable i in every iteration

        (i) Check the condition 'arr[i] % 2 == 0' if true then assign the value of arr[i] into the array evenArray[j] and increment the value of j otherwise                      perform the sub-step ii

        (ii) Assign the value of arr[i] into the array oddArray[k] and increment the value of k

Step 7: Print the elements of array evenArray[] using for loop as the even numbers

Step 8: Print the elements of array oddArray[] using for loop as the odd numbers
